# Brief for the candidate:

BrightHR has a daily reminder feature. This uses email to provide users and/or their managers with reminders of important upcoming events or things they need to take action on. For example:

| Reminder type | Recipients |
|---------------|------------|
| Unread documents (e.g. contract amendment) | User |
| Work anniversary | User & their managers |
| Missing emergency contact details | User & their managers |
| Employee's birthday | Managers |

There are over twenty reminder types and they take widely different times to collate the data they need, sometimes as long as an hour.

The emails are due to be sent between 7-8am in the morning.

BrightHR operates in the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - with data centres across these regions.

Design a solution that would deliver daily reminders to our users.

We do not want to see working code - we are more interested in a broad end-to-end solution - its architecture, key principles and the way you came to decisions about the way it would work.

We do want you to talk about the design and the thinking that got you to it - this will be a dialogue, we will be asking questions and you can ask questions of the interviewer too.

Note down assumptions you make and constraints you might hit.

BrightHR uses Microsoft Azure, but you can base your solution around another cloud provider or on-prem if that's where your experience lies.

You can explain your solution in any way you feel comfortable - pen and pad, on a whiteboard, a slide deck, Visio diagrams, voice and gestures etc.
